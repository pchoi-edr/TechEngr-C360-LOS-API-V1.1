# Cabinets in Collateral 360

All loans in Collateral 360 are organized into cabinets, which
represent arbitrary logical groupings of loans. During
loan creation, users can select which cabinet a loan should
belong to, thereby allowing loans to be organized according
to the organization's needs. Depending on settings and permissions,
a user may also be able to create a new cabinet when creating
a new loan.

Some lending institutions have configured Collateral 360
to never ask which cabinet a loan belongs to. In these
cases, the system maintains a single cabinet for all loans
belonging to that company, and whenever a loan is created
it is automatically assigned to that default cabinet.
