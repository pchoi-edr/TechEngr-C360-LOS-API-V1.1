# SRF API

The SRF API v1.1 is used to create a draft & non-draft service request.
Within Collateral 360, draft service requests are considered
works-in-progress, and therefore can be saved with incomplete
information. They are designed to record the user's work during
the time period when data about a loan or its collateral properties
are still being acquired, or when decisions are still being made
regarding the services to perform for each collateral property.

Non-draft service request can be submitted with errors or incomplete information only if the _**processAsWarnings**_ is set to `true.` If set to `false`, the LOS system will validate all data to ensure it is properly formatted and the correct data type for that field.

The fields accepted by this API are defined by the JSON schema
returned by the [SRF Fields API](srf-fields-api.md).

The API request format is largely identical for both the creation
of new service requests and the modification of existing ones.
The general format is described in the following sections. Any
differences in syntax or usage between these two use cases will
be noted.

**_NOTE: Currently Service Request API does not support International Addressing. However International Addresses can be submitted by setting 'processAsWarnings' as TRUE._**

## API Request Structure

API requests issued to create or modify a service request all have
the same high-level structure.

### Metadata Field Definitions

The following fields should be included in the API request's
top-level `meta` element:

| Metadata Field | Required | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| cabinet | Yes | String | The name of the cabinet that will contain the draft or non-draft SRF. |
| currency | Yes | String | A three-letter ISO 4217 currency code. This must be in uppercase. |
| requestedBy | Yes | String | The email address of the user who is issuing this request (for an HTTP `POST` operation, this will be the service request creator). This must be an email address associated with an appropriate user account in Collateral 360. |
| createdBy | Yes | String | The email address of the user who is creating this request (for an HTTP `POST` operation, this will be the service request creator). This must be an email address associated with an appropriate user account in Collateral 360. |
| srfAction | Yes | String | **_'DRAFT'_** or **_'PROCURE'_**; Draft for draft version of serviceRequest and Procure for non-draft version of serviceRequest |
| processAsWarnings | Yes | Boolean | **_TRUE_** processes ServiceRequest Form regardless of form errors.<br>**_FALSE_** On process errors, doesn't create a ServiceRequest Form and outputs all errors.<br><span style="font-size: 12px;">**NOTE:** exception to processAsWarnings = true, is when data is submitted that violates database field integrity. (i.e. a string submitted when data column indicates an integer)</span> |

#### Meta Options

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "requestedBy": "testmanager@edrnet.com",
    "createdBy": "testmanager@edrnet.com",
    "cabinet": "Testing Cabinet",
    "currency": "USD",
    "srfAction": "DRAFT",
    "processAsWarnings": true
  }
}
```

## Draft vs Non-Draft

### Data Field Definitions

The following elements will be expected within the API request's
top-level `data` element:

| Data Field | Required | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| transaction | Yes | Object | General data fields that describe the service request. |
| collaterals | Yes | Array | An array where each element contains the data fields that describe a single real property used as collateral. |

Note that, depending on your configuration options in Collateral
360, draft & non-draft SRFs may only be visible to the user who created them.
In this case, the `requestedBy` field defines this user within
the original API call used to create a service request.

Unless otherwise noted, all monetary amounts in the request will be
denominated in the specified currency.

### Transaction Field Definitions

The values in the API request's `transaction` element will
vary by client. Each value represents a data field that describes
the overall service request independently of any collateral (such
as a loan principal amount).

The fields that can be included in this section are defined in the
JSON schema returned by the SRF Fields API.

### Collateral Field Definitions

The API request's `collaterals` element consists of an array where
each element represents an individual real property used to
collateralize a loan. As such, the fields in this section can
be repeated between each element.

Similarly to the `transaction` element's contents, the fields in
each element of the `collaterals` array are defined in the JSON
schema returned by the SRF Fields API. However, one additional field
is present:

| Data Field | Required | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| services |Yes| Array | An array of services to perform on the collateral property. |

Each element in the `services` array is an object that represents a
service to perform on a collateral property, such as the following
examples (your set of services may be different):

* Phase I Environmental Report

* Property Appraisal Inspection

Each service is associated with a _feature_, which represents the broad
category of services it belongs to. Typical features may include
environmental services, appraisal services, construction services, _etc._

You may wish to segregate or group services according to their
associated features within your application's user interface to
improve its intuitiveness.

Each element in the `services` array must be an object that has
the following values, which are defined in the JSON schema
returned by the SRF Fields API:

<P style="page-break-before: always" />

| Data Field | Required | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| serviceType | Yes | String | The unique value used to identify each type of service. |

<P style="page-break-before: always" />

## Available API Endpoints

The following endpoints are supported by the SRF API subsystem:

### <span style="background-color: #ebb747; font-weight: bold; color: #ffffff; padding: 3px 10px; border-radius: 14px;">POST</span> **Service Request Form**

```text
/api/v1.1/serviceRequest/form
```

This endpoint is used to create a new service request, and
is invoked via the HTTP `POST` method.

#### Request

##### Path Parameters

This endpoint does not accept any path parameters in its URL.

##### Body Parameters

The API request body conforms to the standard API request
format (_i.e._ a `meta` and a `data` element), per the
[API Data Structures](../request-response-structure.md)
section of this document.

The request's top-level `data` element should contain the
following elements, each of which must conform to the
requirements described above.

* `transaction`

* `collaterals`

The contents of these elements collectively define the contents of
the service request created by a successful invocation of this
endpoint.

If the specified service request is successfully created by this
endpoint, then the API response's `data` element will contain
a `serviceRequestID` element, which will be an integer that
uniquely identifies the newly created service request.

##### Example JSON Request

A request to create a service request might look like the following
in general structure (replacing example values with values appropriate
to your specific application, per the JSON schema returned by the
SRF Fields API):

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "requestedBy": "creator@example.com",
    "createdBy": "testmanager@example.com",
    "cabinet": "Testing Cabinet",
    "currency": "USD",
    "srfAction": "DRAFT",
    "processAsWarnings": true
  },
  "data": {
    "transaction": {
      "exampleTransactionField": "Example Value"
    },
    "collaterals": [
      {
        "exampleCollateralField": "Example Value",
        "services": [
          {
            "siteType": "Appraisal"
          },
          {
            "siteType": "Environmental"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Response

##### Expected HTTP Response Code

When operating normally, this API endpoint will return
an HTTP response code of `201` ("Created").

##### Example JSON Response

A successful API request to create a new service request will
yield an API response similar to the following:

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "date": "2018-04-28T12:23:23Z",
        "function": "create",
        "responseCode": 201,
        "responseID": "3b811014-7984-11e8-adc0-fa7ae01bbebc",
        "success": true,
        "warnings": []
    },
    "data": {
        "serviceRequestID": 1234567,
        "locationID": [
          1234567,
          1234568
        ]
    }
}
```

The `serviceRequestID` element contains a value that uniquely
identifies the newly created service request. Your application
should record this value, since any subsequent API requests you
may issue to modify the new service request must use this
value to identify which service request to update.

The v.1.x+ version of the non-draft service request form, also generates `locationID`'s. Your application should record these values also as downstream API's will require `locationID`'s such as File Upload API.
